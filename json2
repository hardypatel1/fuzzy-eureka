The outside of the skins were so crispy, they tasted like chips.  It came w/ a generous heap of bacon, sour cream, and chives.

Nope but to be truly honest Its not just because its in a flashy Casino that it is expensive. This really is one of the best burgers I have ever had. They also have a Vegan burger for half the price if you're into that sorta thing.\n\nWhy was it so good? The buns were the super big poofy ones that are so nice and pillowy. The burger was very thick and perfectly cooked so that it had the perfect amount of juice.\n\nThe fries were pretty dang good too. \n\nTo top it off I've had a burger in SF that cost the same amount that sucked a$$ so I consider this place a gold mine for burgers.\n\nThanks Wynn."

A Gardein patty on a pasty sesame seed bun, topped with American style \"cheese\". Be sure to ask for lettuce at no charge as it oddly doesn't come standard. If you're feeling frisky, you can top it with avocado for a reasonable (for Vegas) $1.50 more.\n\nA side of tasty seasoned fries and a chocolate milkshake round out the meal. That coconut based choco-shake is a contender for the best Vegan chocolate shake in the world. Or maybe I was just craving something shake-like after being disappointed by Holstein's lack of a Vegan shake. Just be sure you know how to handle your chocolate before you down this bad boy. That sucker packs a wallop!\n\nIs the Gardein patty cooked to perfection? No, not quite. It could use more flame broiling, less microwaving but it's still pretty good and the overall price is right. The pasty bun is pretty pasty tasting as well. However, for a \"cheap\" quick meal in The Wynn, get your ass to Zoozacrackers, conveniently located next to the sports book.\n\nIt must've been good enough that my sweetie risked filling herself up too much before our meal at Sinatra later that night by ordering another one after we finished the first one we shared for lunch.\n\nNote: If you're a glutton for punishment, walk over to The Encore to receive the same meal for $6 more at the Society of Snakes Cafe..."

Very good Matzoh Ball Soup turned out to be a huge fluffy matzoh ball surrounded by numerous noodles, carrots, tender hunks of chicken, and a flavorful chicken broth.  I just ate half of it.\n\nThis was followed by an also very good Lean Corned Beef on Rye, with one slice of nicely melted Swiss Cheese.  Aided by French's Yellow Mustard, the heaping sandwich was just moist enough.  A large side of Potato Salad turned out to be composed of chunks of cooked Redskin potatoes mixed in a very tasty dressing that was tossed over all.  Much of this fine dish was left behind as well.\n\nWith a soft drink, the total bill for one was low according to Wynn restaurant standards but topped $30.00 for one!  I wouldn't want to pay that freight for lunch too often, but the experience compressed into slightly less than an hour (because of a large gathering of lined up fellow diners and a seminar to attend) was very good overall, and bears repeating at a more leisurely pace."
